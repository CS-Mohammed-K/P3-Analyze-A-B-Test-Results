# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project 03 : Analyze A/B Test Results

## Summary

This project is one of the required projects in the Udacity Data Analyst Degree. The goals of this project is to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal is to work through the jupyter Notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
